    <p>Recent years have seen a greater shift towards alternative nosological frameworks of psychopathology, which frequently include a dimension of externalizing psychopathology. The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) is one such framework. However, the HiTOP has been most often studied in adults and more research is needed in order to better understand the similarities and differences in the structure of externalizing psychopathology earlier in development. This preregistered study sought to examine the validity and utility of extending the HiTOP externalizing dimension and its subdimensions to youth using longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. There were two primary aims: Aim 1: Identify the hierarchical structure of externalizing psychopathology and examine evidence of discriminant validity of the identified dimensions; and Aim 2: Assess the longitudinal measurement invariance of a broad externalizing dimension in the ABCD study, as well as specific underlying symptom dimensions. Results for Aim 1 analyses identified a coherent factor structure comprising three dimensions (narrow externalizing, irritability, and neurodevelopmental problems), and these factors showed important similarities and differences in relation to external correlates. Aim 2 analyses showed that strong invariance was supported for the narrow externalizing and irritability dimensions, while partial strong invariance was supported for broad externalizing and neurodevelopmental problems. Quantification of measurement (non)invariance revealed small effect sizes. Collectively, these results highlight important directions for future research on the HiTOP model in the ABCD study and other youth samples.</p>

<p>In recent years, researchers have increasingly pursued alternative nosological frameworks of psychopathology with the goal of enhancing etiological models and, ultimately, improving prevention and intervention efforts <span class="citation" data-cites="eaton2023">(<a href="#ref-eaton2023" role="doc-biblioref">Eaton et al. 2023</a>)</span>. One popular framework, the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology [(]HiTOP; <span class="citation" data-cites="kotov2017">Kotov et al. (<a href="#ref-kotov2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>], has generated significant research interest. The HiTOP aims to establish an empirically derived structure of psychopathology using techniques, such as factor analysis to identify transdiagnostic dimensions that explain covariation among observed symptoms. Importantly, the hierarchical organization of HiTOP incorporates general and specific symptoms of psychopathology, thereby avoiding the limitations of categorical approaches like that of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM-5; <span class="citation" data-cites="apa2013">American Psychiatric Association, Association, et al. (<a href="#ref-apa2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>], including high rates of within-disorder heterogeneity and comorbidity <span class="citation" data-cites="conway2022">(<a href="#ref-conway2022" role="doc-biblioref">Conway et al. 2022</a>)</span>. Thus, the HiTOP aims to generate a nosological framework that is empirically valid and capable of benefiting both researchers and clinicians <span class="citation" data-cites="kotov2021">(<a href="#ref-kotov2021" role="doc-biblioref">Kotov et al. 2021</a>)</span>. Indeed, across a range of mental health problems, dimensional assessments produce greater validity and reliability compared to categorical assessments (e.g., Markon et al., 2011) and emerging evidence suggests that clinicians find more utility in transdiagnostic, dimensional approaches like HiTOP compared to traditional categorical approaches <span class="citation" data-cites="balling2023">(e.g., <a href="#ref-balling2023" role="doc-biblioref">Balling et al. 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>However, the majority of research examining HiTOP has been conducted in adults, leaving notable gaps in our understanding of how it can be extended to youth during sensitive developmental windows. The present study examined whether components of the HiTOP model, specifically its externalizing dimensions, could be identified in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, a longitudinal, nationally representative study of youth in the United States. The longitudinal nature of the ABCD study allows for tests of whether externalizing dimensions are psychometrically invariant over time—an essential precursor to more advanced modeling techniques (e.g., latent growth models) that can be used to study trajectories of externalizing dimensions over development. Addressing these gaps has the potential to expand the relevance of HiTOP to earlier periods of development, a critical step to further advance HiTOP-focused research <span class="citation" data-cites="tackett2022">(<a href="#ref-tackett2022" role="doc-biblioref">Tackett and Hallquist 2022</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hitop-as-a-model-of-externalizing-psychopathology"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> HiTOP as a Model of Externalizing Psychopathology</h2>
<p>The HiTOP is organized along continuous dimensions, consistent with evidence showing that differences in psychopathology are a matter of degree as opposed to kind <span class="citation" data-cites="haslam2012">(<a href="#ref-haslam2012" role="doc-biblioref">Haslam, Holland, and Kuppens 2012</a>)</span>. The HiTOP is also hierarchical, reflecting decades of research establishing that symptoms can be organized into broader dimensions, which in turn can advance research on shared and distinct etiological mechanisms of psychopathology symptoms <span class="citation" data-cites="lahey2017">(<a href="#ref-lahey2017" role="doc-biblioref">Lahey et al. 2017</a>)</span>. At the finest level, the HiTOP provides descriptions of narrow behavioral (e.g., aggression, inattention) and interpersonal (e.g., callousness) symptoms or traits. One can move up the hierarchy to broader dimensions that are called superspectra in the HiTOP (e.g., externalizing and internalizing psychopathology). This dimensional, hierarchical approach allows researchers to study features of psychopathology at varying levels of specificity.</p>
<p>In adults, the externalizing superspectrum encompasses two lower order dimensions (termed spectra in the HiTOP): disinhibited externalizing and antagonistic externalizing <span class="citation" data-cites="krueger2021">(<a href="#ref-krueger2021" role="doc-biblioref">Krueger et al. 2021</a>)</span>. The disinhibited externalizing spectrum includes the tendency to act impulsively, with little regard for future consequences. The antagonistic externalizing spectrum reflects tendencies to navigate interpersonal situations with little concern for others, including a willingness to exploit and deceive others. The broader externalizing dimension has been linked to various maladaptive outcomes, including aggression, antisocial behavior, and problematic substance use <span class="citation" data-cites="krueger2007">(e.g., <a href="#ref-krueger2007" role="doc-biblioref">Krueger et al. 2007</a>)</span>, while the lower order spectra, including disinhibition and antagonism, offer greater specificity and show differential associations with external correlates <span class="citation" data-cites="mullins-sweatt2022">(<a href="#ref-mullins-sweatt2022" role="doc-biblioref">Mullins-Sweatt et al. 2022</a>)</span>. For example, antagonism is more strongly related to various forms of aggression and antisocial behavior relative to disinhibitory symptoms <span class="citation" data-cites="vize2018">(<a href="#ref-vize2018" role="doc-biblioref">Vize, Miller, and Lynam 2018</a>)</span>, while disinhibitory symptoms are more closely related to problematic substance use <span class="citation" data-cites="venables2012">(e.g., <a href="#ref-venables2012" role="doc-biblioref">Venables and Patrick 2012</a>)</span>. While there is substantial evidence supporting the presence of a broad externalizing dimension in youth <span class="citation" data-cites="bongers2004">(e.g., <a href="#ref-bongers2004" role="doc-biblioref">Bongers et al. 2004</a>)</span>, less work has examined whether the antagonistic and disinhibited HiTOP dimensions can be similarly captured in youth samples and if these spectra show unique associations with relevant clinical and psychosocial correlates.</p>

<p>While the HiTOP has seen less direct application in youth samples, there is a rich history of dimensional and hierarchical models of psychopathology in youth. For example, models of externalizing psychopathology have been examined across a wide range of developmental periods, including preschool <span class="citation" data-cites="hill2006">(e.g., <a href="#ref-hill2006" role="doc-biblioref">Hill et al. 2006</a>)</span> and early adolescence <span class="citation" data-cites="goulter2022">(e.g., <a href="#ref-goulter2022" role="doc-biblioref">Goulter et al. 2022</a>)</span>. Across these studies, results have consistently shown that a broadband externalizing factor can be reliably assessed from more fine-grained indicators and the externalizing factor is reliably linked to specific problem behaviors (e.g., aggression and rule-breaking). Notably, this work used a wide variety of indicators to model higher-order externalizing dimensions, including DSM-based diagnostic symptoms <span class="citation" data-cites="king2018">(e.g., <a href="#ref-king2018" role="doc-biblioref">King et al. 2018</a>)</span>, personality features <span class="citation" data-cites="tackett2014">(e.g., <a href="#ref-tackett2014" role="doc-biblioref">Tackett et al. 2014</a>)</span>, and biologically-based indicators like salivary cortisol levels <span class="citation" data-cites="shirtcliff2005">(e.g., <a href="#ref-shirtcliff2005" role="doc-biblioref">Shirtcliff et al. 2005</a>)</span>. Other relevant examples of externalizing-related research in youth involve research on hierarchical models of maladaptive personality that include antagonistic and disinhibitory personality features, which have also found strong support in youth samples <span class="citation" data-cites="fruyt2014">(e.g., <a href="#ref-fruyt2014" role="doc-biblioref">Fruyt and Clercq 2014</a>)</span>. Taken together, this work suggests that dimensional, hierarchical approaches like HiTOP can be successfully applied to youth populations—and, moreover, that HiTOP can serve as a unifying framework for many existing lines of developmental psychopathology research.</p>
<p>Along these lines, more recent work has sought to explicitly examine the HiTOP model in youth samples. For example, using data from the baseline assessment of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)TM study, <span class="citation" data-cites="michelini2019">Michelini et al. (<a href="#ref-michelini2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> conducted a “bass-ackwards” factor analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="goldberg2006">(<a href="#ref-goldberg2006" role="doc-biblioref">Goldberg 2006</a>)</span> using 102 items of the parent-report Child Behavior Checklist <span class="citation" data-cites="achenbach1999">(<a href="#ref-achenbach1999" role="doc-biblioref">Achenbach 1999</a>)</span>. At the most specific level of the hierarchy, the authors identified five factors that they labeled externalizing, neurodevelopmental, internalizing, somatoform, and detachment. The authors noted that the factors mostly align with the structure of psychopathology as detailed in HiTOP, with the exception that the neurodevelopmental factor that emerged from the broader externalizing factor is not included in the HiTOP model. In a more recent effort, <span class="citation" data-cites="forbes2023">Forbes (<a href="#ref-forbes2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> pooled youth self-report data across various early- and mid-adolescent samples (age range=6-18 years old; N=18,290) to identify similarities and differences between the hierarchical structure of symptoms in youth and the HiTOP structure in adults. The broad factors identified were termed externalizing, eating pathology, uncontrollable worry/obsessions and compulsions, and internalizing. Additionally, more specific dimensions of externalizing were noted, including impulsive anger, antagonism, retaliatory anger, and positive psychosis. While the antagonism dimension mirrored the antagonistic externalizing dimension in adults (i.e., consisting of items indexing aggression and cruelty towards others), no clear disinhibited externalizing factor emerged. Instead, items reflecting disinhibitory content (e.g., “Generally, I am an impulsive person”) showed primary loadings on the impulsive anger dimension. Thus, existing research has highlighted similarities and differences between the HiTOP model among adults and youth. Further research is needed to further clarify how the HiTOP could be extended to youth.</p>

<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="longitudinal-invariance-of-externalizing-psychopathology-in-youth"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Longitudinal Invariance of Externalizing Psychopathology in Youth</h2>
<p>In addition to characterizing the hierarchical structure of externalizing psychopathology in youth, it is important to determine whether this structure is consistent over time <span class="citation" data-cites="vandenberg2000">(<a href="#ref-vandenberg2000" role="doc-biblioref">Vandenberg and Lance 2000</a>)</span>. Specifically, examining the longitudinal measurement invariance of externalizing psychopathology, or the degree to which the measurement of this latent construct is psychometrically equivalent over time, can help establish whether observed changes reflect true changes. Because the developmentally relevant behavioral and interpersonal manifestations of externalizing psychopathology are known to change across development <span class="citation" data-cites="petersen2020">(<a href="#ref-petersen2020" role="doc-biblioref">Petersen, Choe, and LeBeau 2020</a>)</span>, establishing longitudinal measurement invariance is necessary to ensure that observed changes are reflective of changes in externalizing rather than developmentally limited indicators. For example, decreases in temper tantrums are likely to reflect an independent developmental process separate from true decreases in a latent externalizing propensity. Longitudinal invariance is particularly important in the ABCD study, given its unique potential to serve as a scientific resource as a nationally representative, longitudinal study of youth and their families. The ABCD study is ideally situated to provide data that can better characterize risk and resilience factors for within-individual change in externalizing psychopathology. Thus, the transparent development of longitudinally invariant measurement models of externalizing dimensions is essential.</p>

The current study had two aims: <strong>Aim 1</strong>: Identify the hierarchical structure of externalizing psychopathology and examine evidence of discriminant validity of the identified dimensions; and <strong>Aim 2</strong>: Assess the longitudinal measurement invariance of a broad externalizing dimension in the ABCD study as well as more specific dimensions underlying broad externalizing symptoms. Collectively, the current study aimed to investigate the validity and utility of disaggregating the externalizing dimension specifically in youth during a developmentally sensitive window.</p>

<p>Data were drawn from four waves (baseline, 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up) of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)TM study (N=11,875 at baseline; Mage=9.51; 48% girls; 57% White; 15% Black; 20% Hispanic/Latino/a). For our primary measures, sample sizes ranged from N=11,862 at baseline to N=10,099 at the 3-year follow-up assessment. A more complete description of the ABCD study, including previous publications using the data, is available at the [ABCD Study site] (https://abcdstudy.org/).</p>
</section>
<section id="measures" class="level2" data-number="7">
<h2 data-number="7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="measures"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Measures</h2>
<p><strong>Externalizing Dimensions (Parent-Report: T1-T4)</strong>. Externalizing psychopathology was assessed using a subset of items from the parent-report Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL; <span class="citation" data-cites="achenbach1999">Achenbach (<a href="#ref-achenbach1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>)</span>], which was administered at all four assessments. Specifically, we used the 45 CBCL items and item composites identified in factor analyses of the ABCD baseline data by <span class="citation" data-cites="michelini2019">Michelini et al. (<a href="#ref-michelini2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> that had primary loadings on the externalizing factor and/or the neurodevelopmental factor. These two factors had a total of 45 items/item composites that showed either primary loadings on one of the factors or loaded on both factors without a clear primary loading (e.g., the item “impulsive or acts without thinking” had a loading of .49 on both the externalizing and neurodevelopmental factors). The preregistration provides details for the specific CBCL items that were used for our analyses.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic Symptom Counts (Parent- and Youth-Report; T1)</strong>. Symptom counts were assessed using clinician ratings of parent- and youth-reported modules of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia [KSADS-5; <span class="citation" data-cites="kobak2013">Kobak et al. (<a href="#ref-kobak2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>]. Dimensional symptom counts for the following diagnostic constructs were used: conduct disorder (CD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder, suicidality/self-harm, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Each symptom was indicated as being present (1) or not present (0), and symptoms were summed such that higher scores indicate more symptoms endorsed for the diagnostic construct. Parents completed all KSADS-5 modules at the baseline assessment, while youth only completed mood disorder, social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, suicidality, and sleep modules at baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Prosocial Behavior (Parent- and Youth-Report; T1)</strong>. Prosocial behavior was assessed using the prosocial scale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which included 3 items (“try to be nice to other people”; “care about their feelings”; “offer to help others”). Items were rated on a 3-point scale ranging from 0 (not true) to 2 (certainly true) and summed such that higher scores represent greater levels of prosocial behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Impulsivity (Youth-Report; T1)</strong>. Impulsivity was assessed using the youth-reported Urgency, Premeditation (lack of), Perseverance (lack of), Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency, Impulsive Behavior Scale (UPPS-P for Children Short Form – ABCD version). The scale had 20 items assessing impulsivity (e.g., “I like to stop and think about things before I do them (reversed)”) and includes 5 subscales: negative urgency, positive urgency, lack of perseverance, lack of planning, and sensation seeking. Items were rated on a 4-point scale from 1 (not at all like me) to 4 (very much like me) and summed such that higher scores represent higher impulsivity.</p>
<p><strong>Fluid Intelligence</strong> Composite (T1). Fluid intelligence was assessed using an age-corrected composite of 5 tasks from the NIH Toolbox Cognition measures <span class="citation" data-cites="luciana2018">(see <a href="#ref-luciana2018" role="doc-biblioref">Luciana et al. 2018</a> for a detailed description)</span>: List Sorting Working Memory Test, Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test, Picture Sequence Memory Test, Flanker Task, and Dimensional Change Card Sort Test. These tasks collectively assess abilities related to processing speed, episodic memory, working memory, cognitive control, and cognitive flexibility.</p>

<p><strong>Aim 1a Analyses</strong>: We used parallel analysis and the minimum average partial correlation (MAP) to estimate the number of factors to extract from the 45 items/composites. Next, we used <span class="citation" data-cites="forbes2023">Forbes (<a href="#ref-forbes2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> recently developed extension to Goldberg’s “bass-ackwards” analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="goldberg2006">(<a href="#ref-goldberg2006" role="doc-biblioref">Goldberg 2006</a>)</span> to identify the hierarchical structure of externalizing items/composites using the minimum residual factor extraction method and promax rotation. <span class="citation" data-cites="forbes2023">Forbes (<a href="#ref-forbes2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> extended bass-ackwards approach differs from the traditional approach in that it 1) identifies redundant components that perpetuate through multiple levels of the hierarchy; 2) aids in identification of artifactual components; and 3) plots the strongest factor correlations among the remaining factors to identify their hierarchical structure. Although past work has used similar factor analytic approaches on CBCL data in the ABCD sample <span class="citation" data-cites="michelini2019">(e.g., <a href="#ref-michelini2019" role="doc-biblioref">Michelini et al. 2019</a>)</span>, by constraining our analyses to only focus on the 45 CBCL items/composites associated with broad externalizing, we expected more fine-grained differences to emerge in the hierarchical structure of the CBCL items/composites. <strong>Aim 1b Analyses</strong>: After identifying the hierarchical structure of externalizing dimensions, we assessed evidence discriminant validity by examining bivariate and semipartial correlations between the identified externalizing dimensions (assessed using factor scores) and external criterion measures (e.g., diagnostic symptom counts, prosocial behavior, impulsivity, fluid intelligence). Correlations for specific dimensions were also compared to one another using tests of dependent correlations to detect significant differences between correlations.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 2a Analyses</strong>: Next, we examined the longitudinal measurement invariance of each externalizing dimension through a series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). Longitudinal measurement invariance was examined in typical fashion moving from configural to strong invariance. In some cases, we also examined strict invariance. To test this, we created item parcels from the CBCL items based on a set of preregistered criteria. The item parcels served as the observed indicators of externalizing dimensions for all tests of longitudinal measurement invariance. <strong>Aim 2b Analyses</strong>: To quantify the degree of invariance, we computed Cohen’s d for mean and covariance structures [dMACS; <span class="citation" data-cites="nye2011">Nye and Drasgow (<a href="#ref-nye2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>]. These metrics index the collective impact of loading and intercept noninvariance in the metric of Cohen’s d, with higher values indicating a greater degree of indicator noninvariance.</p>

<h2 data-number="9" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preregistered-hypotheses"><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Preregistered Hypotheses</h2>
<p>We had three primary hypotheses. Hypothesis 1a: We hypothesized that disinhibition and antagonism dimensions would be identified at more fine-grained levels of the hierarchy with the same items that have been shown to comprise a broad externalizing dimension. If parallel analysis and the minimum average partial correlation test (MAP) suggested a relatively large number of factors could be extracted from the CBCL items (e.g., 5 or more), we expected that the disinhibition and antagonism factors would emerge relatively early in the factor extraction process (e.g., at level 2 or level 3). Hypothesis 1b: We expected evidence of discriminant findings for the derived disinhibition and antagonism factor scores derived. Specifically, we hypothesized that the disinhibition factor would have larger (+) associations with ADHD, impulsivity, and fluid intelligence and the antagonism factor would have larger (-) associations with CD, ODD, and prosocial behavior. Furthermore, we expected these correlations to be significantly stronger than the correlations disinhibition and antagonism showed with internalizing outcomes. Hypothesis 2: We would be able to establish longitudinal strong measurement invariance for the measurement models of externalizing factors, facilitating future investigations of mean-level change over time in these externalizing factors in the ABCD study.</p>

<p><strong>Aim 1a: Hierarchical structure of externalizing psychopathology</strong> Results of the parallel analysis based on polychoric correlations among the CBCL items suggested up to 14 factors could be extracted from the 45 CBCL items, while MAP suggested four factors for extraction. Consistent with our preregistered criteria for factor extraction, we interpreted the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-factor solutions. However, the fourth factor of the solution was not substantively meaningful, and we thus focus on the 3-factor hierarchy.</p>
<p>The first level of the bass-ackwards hierarchy was a broad externalizing factor with all 45 CBCL items showing moderately strong to strong standardized loadings on the factor (range=.47-.81). At the second level, a neurodevelopmental problems factor emerged, characterized by distractibility, poor motor coordination, and hyperactivity. The broad externalizing factor remained virtually unchanged and was strongly correlated with the broad externalizing factor from level 1 of the hierarchy (r=.96). At level 3, the neurodevelopmental problems factor remained unchanged (r=1.00 with the level 2 factor). However, the broad externalizing factor split into a narrower externalizing and an irritability factor, both of which were strongly related to the broad externalizing factor (rs=.91). The narrow externalizing factor was characterized by aggression (e.g., threatening others, fighting), meanness to others (e.g., cruelty, bullying, lack of guilt), and rule-breaking behaviors (e.g., stealing, destroys composite), and the irritability factor was indexed by items related to affective reactivity and lability, hostility, and distrust of others. These three levels of the hierarchy are displayed in Figure 1. The extracted factor scores from level 3 were strongly related to the broad externalizing factor score (r range=.80-.87) from level 1 and positively related to one another (r range =.52-.62). Aim 1b: Discriminant validity of the identified dimensions</p>
<p>We extracted scores for the factors identified at level 3 of the bass-ackwards hierarchy: narrow externalizing, irritability, and neurodevelopmental problems. Factor scores were also extracted for broad externalizing (i.e., externalizing at level 1 of the bass-ackwards hierarchy). Correlations between factor scores and external criterion measures are presented in <strong>Table 1</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Diagnostic Symptom Counts (Parent- and Youth-Report)</em>. At the bivariate level, all factors were positively associated with symptom counts across all disorders and informants, and associations were stronger for parent-reported symptoms (r range=.07-.66) compared to youth-reported symptoms (r range=.04-.16). Furthermore, these factors tended to be more strongly related to symptoms of CD, ODD, and ADHD (r range=.31-.60) compared to symptoms of depression and anxiety (r range=.04-.32).</p>
<p>Semipartial correlations accentuated differences observed at the bivariate level, most prominently for parent-report, providing strong evidence for discriminant validity. Compared to other factors, narrow externalizing showed the strongest associations with CD symptoms (sr=.59) and the irritability factor with ODD symptoms (sr=.43). The neurodevelopmental problems factor was unrelated to CD (sr=-.02) and ODD (sr=-.04) symptoms, and strongly associated with ADHD symptoms (sr=.50). Associations with depression and anxiety symptoms were notably smaller, and after accounting for overlap, the narrow externalizing factor demonstrated a negative association with generalized (sr=-.12) and social (sr=-.05) anxiety disorder symptoms. The irritability factor showed the strongest association with depression (sr=.20) and generalized anxiety symptoms (sr=.21) and the neurodevelopmental problems factor with social anxiety disorder (sr=.13). Notably, there was little difference across the three factors in the strength of associations with suicidality/self-harm (sr range=.08-.11).</p>
<p><em>Prosocial Behavior (Parent- and Youth-Report)</em>. At the bivariate level, all factors were negatively associated with prosocial behavior, and these associations were stronger for parent-report (r range=-.22 to -.35) compared to youth-report (r range=-.06 to -.09). Semipartial correlations were smaller for narrow externalizing (sr=-.21) and irritability (sr=-.18), and reduced to non-significance for neurodevelopmental problems (sr=-.01).</p>
<p><em>Impulsivity</em>. All factors showed similarly sized positive associations to all indices of impulsivity, though these were notably small in magnitude (r=.04-.16). The narrow externalizing and irritability factors showed the strongest associations with negative urgency (.16 and .15, respectively), and the neurodevelopmental problems factor was most strongly associated with lack of perseverance (r=.18). Semipartial correlations were smaller in magnitude, but similar to one another. The exception was the relation between neurodevelopmental problems and lack of perseverance (sr=.18), compared to the relation to the other factors (sr range=-.02-.03).</p>
<p><em>Fluid Intelligence</em>. All factors were negatively associated with fluid intelligence, though these associations were small in magnitude. The neurodevelopmental problems factor demonstrated the strongest negative association (r=-.17), followed by the narrow externalizing factor (r=-.14), and the irritability factor (r=-.08). Semipartial correlations were similar, though the relation between irritability and fluid intelligence became positive (sr=.08).</p>
<p><strong>Aim 2a: Longitudinal Measurement Invariance</strong> All items were randomly assigned to parcels, and the parcels were used as indicators of a given latent factor at baseline, one-year follow-up, two-year follow-up, and three-year follow-up assessments. <strong>Supplementary Table S1</strong> provides details on the number of items assigned to each parcel and item content for each parcel. <strong>Supplementary Tables S2-S5</strong> provide descriptive statistics for the parcel indicators for each factor. <strong>Table 2</strong> provides results for all tests of longitudinal measurement invariance. All models of the broad externalizing factor and the three narrower factors showed excellent absolute fit across all invariance tests, and strong standardized factor loadings for the parcels (λs=.58-.89) in the configural models, as well as strong stability over time (rs=.68-.81). Model comparison results are summarized below (see Table 2).</p>
<p><em>Broad Externalizing Factor</em>. Relative to the configural model, restricting factor loadings to be equal (i.e., test of weak invariance) did not decrement model fit (ΔCFI=.001; ΔNCI=.005). However, constraining the parcel indicator intercepts to be equal across time (i.e., the test of strong invariance) did result in a significant decrement in model fit (ΔCFI=.004; ΔNCI=.026). In an attempt to establish partial strong invariance, we freed the intercept constraints on parcels 4 and 5 based on modification indices. This model demonstrated excellent overall fit (χ^2=947.21; df=152; RMSEA=.021; CFI=.994; TLI=.992) and showed no decrement in model fit compared to the weak invariance model of broad externalizing (ΔCFI=.000; ΔNCI=.001), indicating that partial strong longitudinal measurement invariance was supported. Given that full strong invariance was not supported, we did not test for strict measurement invariance.</p>
<p><em>Narrow Externalizing Factor</em>. Model fit was not significantly impacted by adding constraints for weak, strong, or strict measurement invariance. Thus, we were able to demonstrate strict longitudinal measurement invariance for the narrow externalizing factor.</p>
<p><em>Irritability</em>. Model fit was not significantly impacted by adding constraints for weak or strong measurement invariance. However, the constraints for strict invariance resulted in a significant decrement in model fit (ΔCFI=.003; ΔNCI=.009). Thus, we were only able to demonstrate strong longitudinal measurement invariance.</p>
<p><em>Neurodevelopmental Problems</em>. Relative to the configural model, model fit was not significantly impacted after constraining factor loadings to be equal (ΔCFI=.002; ΔNCI=.005), indicating weak measurement invariance. However, after imposing constraints on the intercepts of the parcel indicators (strong invariance), model fit was significantly negatively impacted (ΔCFI=.006; ΔNCI=.018). Based on modification indices, the intercepts of parcels 3 and 4 were freed at baseline and three-year follow-up. The resulting partial strong measurement invariance model showed excellent overall fit (χ^2=524.25; df=88; RMSEA=.020; CFI=.993; TLI=.991) and no decrement in model fit compared to the weak invariance model (ΔCFI=.002; ΔNCI=.005), indicating that partial strong longitudinal measurement invariance was supported.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 2b: Effect Sizes for Longitudinal Measurement Noninvariance</strong> <strong>Table 3</strong> provides results for dMACS and additional effect sizes (i.e., proportion of mean change in the latent factor attributable to noninvariance) for the broad externalizing factor and neurodevelopmental problems factor (i.e., the two factors for which noninvariance was detected). Results showed that the effect sizes of indicator noninvariance were small, with dMACS ranging from .00-.18. While dMACS summarized the magnitude of noninvariance at the indicator level, there was a more noticeable impact of noninvariance at the latent level of the broad externalizing dimension, with noninvariance accounting for between 25-30% of observed mean change in the dimension across the pairwise comparisons.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitivity Analyses</strong> We conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of our results relative to other analytic choices. This included 1) examining alternative factoring and rotation methods for our bass-ackwards analysis, 2) exploring the impact of variability in item-parcel allocation on measurement model parameters (i.e., loadings) and model fit statistics, and 3) examining the impact of cluster effects of family and study site in the ABCD study. Overall, sensitivity analyses showed that all results were robust to these factors. An overview of these analyses and results are provided in Supplementary Materials (see <strong>Section II</strong> and <strong>Table S6</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong> The present study sought to delineate the hierarchical structure of externalizing symptoms in the ABCD study, and evaluate the longitudinal measurement invariance of the identified dimensions. Overall, there was mixed support for our preregistered hypotheses. Specifically, in our bass-ackwards analysis, we did not find evidence for easily interpretable disinhibition or antagonism dimensions (<em>Hypothesis 1a</em>) and instead identified three factors: narrow externalizing, irritability, and neurodevelopmental problems. There was support for the discriminant validity of the specific externalizing dimensions (<em>Hypothesis 1b</em>) and, consistent with our hypothesis (<em>Hypothesis 2</em>), strong measurement invariance was established for two of these factors (narrow externalizing and irritability). While strong invariance could not be established for the broad externalizing and neurodevelopmental problems factors, a less restrictive model (partial strong invariance) was supported. Importantly, effect size metrics for longitudinal invariance highlighted the necessity of examining the impact of noninvariance at the level of indicators and latent dimensions, as noninvariance showed the greatest impact on the latent level here. Together, results have implications for extending the HiTOP model to youth and for future research on the development of externalizing problems in the ABCD study as well as other prospective, longitudinal studies.</p>
<p><strong>Hierarchical Structure of Externalizing Psychopathology: Links to the HiTOP Model</strong> While the current study identified a broad externalizing dimension that strongly aligns with the externalizing superspectrum of HiTOP <span class="citation" data-cites="krueger2021">(<a href="#ref-krueger2021" role="doc-biblioref">Krueger et al. 2021</a>)</span>, the specific externalizing dimensions showed greater divergence from what has been found in adults. Contrary to hypotheses, clear disinhibition or antagonism dimensions were not identified. Instead, three dimensions with notable links to prior work and some similarities to the HiTOP model emerged. The first was a narrow externalizing dimension, consisting of aggression, meanness to others, and rule breaking behaviors. This factor mirrored antagonism dimensions identified in similar HiTOP-focused analyses in youth samples, which included items associated with aggressive behavior and meanness toward others <span class="citation" data-cites="forbes2023">(<a href="#ref-forbes2023" role="doc-biblioref">Forbes 2023</a>)</span>. In our sample, this dimension also contained content aligned with rule-breaking behavior (e.g., stealing, vandalism), which stands somewhat in contrast to past research highlighting the importance of distinguishing rule-breaking behaviors from more overtly antagonistic behaviors like aggression <span class="citation" data-cites="burt2012">(<a href="#ref-burt2012" role="doc-biblioref">Burt 2012</a>)</span>. Interestingly, even at subsequent levels of the bass-ackwards hierarchy, this narrow externalizing factor did not split into more more specific antagonistic (e.g., aggression, callousness) or rule-breaking factors, suggesting that these features could not be empirically separated. While this may be related to developmental timing and/or the nature of this community sample, it will be important to continue examining the hierarchical structure of externalizing pathology across development, and empirically determine if and when these dimensions differentiate in the ABCD Study.</p>
<p>Results also identified an irritability dimension, characterized by affective reactivity and lability, hostility, and distrust of others. While not predicted, this dimension echoes prior work documenting the central role of irritability in early manifestations of externalizing behavior in youth <span class="citation" data-cites="leibenluft2013">(<a href="#ref-leibenluft2013" role="doc-biblioref">Leibenluft and Stoddard 2013</a>)</span>. Notably, characteristics of the irritability dimension found here – hostility and distrust of others – are similar to features of the antagonistic externalizing dimension that has been identified in adult samples <span class="citation" data-cites="mullins-sweatt2022">(<a href="#ref-mullins-sweatt2022" role="doc-biblioref">Mullins-Sweatt et al. 2022</a>)</span>. However, this dimension was also characterized by a general moodiness that is not explicitly interpersonal in nature, and may point to affective lability as a developmental precursor to interpersonal hostility. In addition, extant research shows that irritability is an important subdimension of externalizing behaviors in youth that predicts subsequent internalizing psychopathology <span class="citation" data-cites="burke2012">(e.g., <a href="#ref-burke2012" role="doc-biblioref">Burke 2012</a>)</span>. Moreover, irritability is a transdiagnostic factor observed in an array of psychiatric disorders, and can help to explain the co-occurrence of externalizing and internalizing problems <span class="citation" data-cites="finlay-jones2023">(<a href="#ref-finlay-jones2023" role="doc-biblioref">Finlay-Jones et al. 2023</a>)</span>. Thus, irritability represents an important dimension within developmental models of externalizing behavior and extensions of the HiTOP to youth.</p>
<p>A neurodevelopmental problems dimension defined by inattention and hyperactivity emerged and remained intact across all levels of our bass-ackwards hierarchy. Notably, much of the factor content aligns with ADHD symptoms, and past structural work in the ABCD study has labeled related factors “inattention” or “ADHD” factors <span class="citation" data-cites="clark2023">(e.g., <a href="#ref-clark2023" role="doc-biblioref">Clark et al. 2023</a>)</span>. Nonetheless, the presence of such a factor echoes prior work on the structure of psychopathology in youth <span class="citation" data-cites="michelini2019 holmes2021">(<a href="#ref-michelini2019" role="doc-biblioref">Michelini et al. 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-holmes2021" role="doc-biblioref">Holmes et al. 2021</a>)</span> and underscores the importance of this dimension in developmental models of externalizing behavior. Moreover, the emergence of this dimension dovetails with other research emphasizing the importance of understanding neurodevelopmental problems as a transdiagnostic dimension in youth psychopathology <span class="citation" data-cites="astle2022">(<a href="#ref-astle2022" role="doc-biblioref">Astle et al. 2022</a>)</span>. Past research has also emphasized the importance of neurodevelopmental problems in the onset and persistence of antisocial behavior <span class="citation" data-cites="goozen2022">(<a href="#ref-goozen2022" role="doc-biblioref">Goozen, Langley, and Hobson 2022</a>)</span>, which further contextualizes the presence of neurodevelopmental problems within the domain of youth externalizing problems.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence of Discriminant Validity for Externalizing Dimensions</strong> The three identified externalizing dimensions demonstrated evidence of discriminant validity based on their bivariate correlations. This was most notable for parent-reported diagnostic symptom counts and prosocial behavior, which may be unsurprising given shared method variance. The largest differences between dimensions were observed for disorders that are typically conceptualized as externalizing, with the narrow externalizing factor demonstrating the strongest association with CD symptoms, the irritability factor with ODD symptoms, and the neurodevelopmental problems factor with ADHD symptoms.</p>
<p>Controlling for overlap among the dimensions generally enhanced this pattern of discriminant validity, but several results are noteworthy. First, the unique variance in the narrow externalizing dimension showed the smallest relations to internalizing symptoms and was negatively related to anxiety disorder symptoms, while maintaining similar relations with conduct disorder symptoms and prosocial behavior. Thus, the unique aspects of this dimension appear to be aligned with callous-unemotional features—past research has demonstrated how these features are weakly related to broad internalizing problems <span class="citation" data-cites="cardinale2020">(<a href="#ref-cardinale2020" role="doc-biblioref">Cardinale and Marsh 2020</a>)</span> and demonstrate negative relations with with anxiety specifically <span class="citation" data-cites="frick1999">(e.g., <a href="#ref-frick1999" role="doc-biblioref">Frick et al. 1999</a>)</span>. Second, the irritability dimension maintained the strongest associations with mood and anxiety symptoms even after accounting for overlap between factors, echoing research pointing to irritability as a transdiagnostic indicator of psychopathology <span class="citation" data-cites="finlay-jones2023">(<a href="#ref-finlay-jones2023" role="doc-biblioref">Finlay-Jones et al. 2023</a>)</span>. Finally, the unique variance in neurodevelopmental problems was unrelated to CD, and ODD symptoms as well as prosociality. This finding has implications for research on “cool” (abstract-cognitive) and “hot” (reward-related) executive functioning systems, and suggests that the unique variance in the neurodevelopmental problems dimension appears to largely reflect the “cold” end of the hot-cold continuum in executive function <span class="citation" data-cites="zelazo2020">(<a href="#ref-zelazo2020" role="doc-biblioref">Zelazo 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Longitudinal Measurement Invariance for Externalizing Dimensions</strong> Tests of longitudinal measurement invariance showed that strict invariance held for the narrow externalizing dimension and strong invariance held for the irritability dimension. Statistically, strong invariance indicates that all longitudinal changes in the means and covariances of the indicators can be attributed to changes in their respective latent dimensions across time <span class="citation" data-cites="grimm2017">(<a href="#ref-grimm2017" role="doc-biblioref">Grimm, Ram, and Estabrook 2017</a>)</span>. Substantively, strong invariance indicates that researchers can conduct comparisons across time for these externalizing dimensions and investigate their associations with other variables without worrying that the indicators have been systematically influenced by unmeasured factors <span class="citation" data-cites="sidaman2010">(<a href="#ref-sidaman2010" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>sidaman2010?</strong></a>)</span>. Notably, partial strong invariance was met for the broad externalizing and neurodevelopmental problems factors, indicating that longitudinal changes in observed indicator means and covariances are attributable to changes in the latent means, <em>but only for the longitudinally invariant indicators</em>. Given that the neurodevelopmental problems factor, in particular, focuses on developmentally specific content that likely manifests differently as youth mature, some degree of noninvariance is unsurprising <span class="citation" data-cites="petersen2020">(<a href="#ref-petersen2020" role="doc-biblioref">Petersen, Choe, and LeBeau 2020</a>)</span>. Though strong invariance is the typical benchmark that must be met before making mean comparisons across time, researchers commonly use partial strong invariance models of externalizing <span class="citation" data-cites="king2018">(e.g., <a href="#ref-king2018" role="doc-biblioref">King et al. 2018</a>)</span> and simulation-based investigations have found that using partially invariant models for subsequent analyses does not result in biased parameters in common applied settings <span class="citation" data-cites="shi2019">(<a href="#ref-shi2019" role="doc-biblioref">Shi, Song, and Lewis 2019</a>)</span>. Taken together, findings provide empirical support for the examination of between- and within-person change in these latent externalizing dimensions over time.</p>
<p>Additionally, our investigation of invariance effect sizes, while not commonly assessed or reported, points to important additional areas of consideration. First, all <em>dMACS</em> for the broad externalizing and neurodevelopmental problem models (i.e., the two models where noninvariant indicators were detected) fell below our preregistered threshold for inferring meaningful impact of measurement invariance (<em>dMACS</em> &lt; .20). This suggests that even though our previous tests indicated that constraining intercepts significantly worsened model fit, the difference in indicator intercepts across time was very small — providing further support for the notion that our findings of only partial strong invariance for certain factors do not preclude their use in subsequent analyses. Second, despite the consistently small <em>dMACS</em> effect sizes, there was a noteworthy impact of noninvariance but only at the latent level of broad externalizing. Specifically, between 25-30% of observed mean differences were due to measurement invariance. Substantively, this suggests that comparisons between the broad externalizing dimension at baseline and later time points will overestimate mean differences if this bias is not taken into account. These results highlight a well-known, but infrequently examined, implication of measurement noninvariance <span class="citation" data-cites="vandenberg2000">(<a href="#ref-vandenberg2000" role="doc-biblioref">Vandenberg and Lance 2000</a>)</span>—that the cumulative effects of noninvariant indicators can lead to larger biasing effects at the latent level (observed for broad externalizing), or in other cases, indicators can cancel out, leading to almost no bias at the latent level (observed for neurodevelopmental problems). Results underscore the importance of examining the effect of longitudinal noninvariance at the latent <em>and</em> indicator level <span class="citation" data-cites="clark2021">(<a href="#ref-clark2021" role="doc-biblioref">Clark and Donellan 2021</a>)</span>. Future work examining the latent broad externalizing factor over time would need to consider the biasing impact of noninvariance. For other externalizing dimensions, the impact of noninvariance was trivial (neurodevelopmental problems) or there was evidence in support of strong measurement invariance (narrow externalizing, irritability), suggesting the examination of their trajectories will reflect true changes and not measurement artifacts.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong> While the current study addresses notable gaps in the literature, results should be considered in light of several noteworthy limitations. First, as is the case with any factor analytic technique, the solution is dependent on the input <span class="citation" data-cites="fabrigar1999">(<a href="#ref-fabrigar1999" role="doc-biblioref">Fabrigar et al. 1999</a>)</span>. That is, our results assume that the CBCL items provide sufficient coverage of the externalizing dimension. While the CBCL is well-validated and extensively used in developmental samples, insufficient coverage of any specific content (e.g., lying) and/or low base rates of less developmentally salient behaviors (e.g., substance use) limit our ability to identify such dimensions. This point is important to keep in mind when drawing comparisons with other studies that have utilized different measures of externalizing behaviors <span class="citation" data-cites="forbes2023">(e.g., <a href="#ref-forbes2023" role="doc-biblioref">Forbes 2023</a>)</span> as they may differ in content coverage that generate divergent factor solutions, particularly at more fine-grained levels.</p>
<p>Second, externalizing dimensions were assessed using a single informant (i.e., parent-report) and it is perhaps unsurprising that associations with external clinical correlates were strongest for parent-reported indices. Given that cross-informant reliability for externalizing psychopathology in youth is consistently low <span class="citation" data-cites="reyes2004">(<a href="#ref-reyes2004" role="doc-biblioref">Reyes and Kazdin 2004</a>)</span>, it will be particularly important to examine the structure of externalizing dimensions in the ABCD study using alternative informants (e.g., youth, teacher). Additionally, expanding beyond monomethod assessments and incorporating multiple levels of analysis to more precisely conceptualize psychopathology constructs dimensions will be important <span class="citation" data-cites="joyner2023">(e.g., <a href="#ref-joyner2023" role="doc-biblioref">Joyner and Perkins 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, while the present study made use of recommended best-practices when using parcels <span class="citation" data-cites="sterba2023">(see <a href="#ref-sterba2023" role="doc-biblioref">Sterba and Rights 2023</a>)</span>, including a transparent preregistration, empirically identified unidimensional factors, and inclusion of sensitivity analyses examining the impact of item-parcel allocation variability, the use of parcels has well-documented limitations. For example, their use necessarily overlooks fine-grained psychometric information about specific items. Though our focus was on latent externalizing dimensions and not item psychometrics per se, item-level characteristics are valuable to understand and future work could aim to better assess this and further refine the assessment of externalizing dimensions.</p>
<p><strong>Future Directions</strong> An important goal is to further expand investigations into the HiTOP in youth to better understand the lower-order structure of psychopathology symptoms. Our findings are in line with emerging evidence suggesting that the broad externalizing dimension of HiTOP is compatible across adults and youth <span class="citation" data-cites="michelini2019 forbes2023">(e.g., <a href="#ref-michelini2019" role="doc-biblioref">Michelini et al. 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-forbes2023" role="doc-biblioref">Forbes 2023</a>)</span>; however, organization of finer-grained dimensions is less consistent. A valuable question for further research would be to examine the replicability of the finer-grained dimensions of externalizing symptoms identified here, using alternative assessments, informants, and developmental timepoints. Future research can also examine other factors relevant to measurement invariance (e.g., sex, ethnicity) using the measurement models developed in the present study. However, subgroup analyses using the parcel developed in the present study would necessitate further sensitivity analyses, as within-sample item-parcel allocation variability is proportional to sampling error <span class="citation" data-cites="sterba2010">(<a href="#ref-sterba2010" role="doc-biblioref">Sterba and MacCallum 2010</a>)</span>, meaning that our use of the total sample in the ABCD study helped minimize item-parcel allocation variability.</p>
<p>Last, future work can also examine alternative hierarchical modeling frameworks. Our bass-ackwards approach can be contrasted with higher-order factor models estimated from ABCD study data <span class="citation" data-cites="clark2023">(e.g., <a href="#ref-clark2023" role="doc-biblioref">Clark et al. 2023</a>)</span> in terms of how variance is partitioned—in higher-order factor models, each level of the hierarchy is based on different variances. For example, the broad externalizing dimension in a higher-order model would represent the shared variance among narrow externalizing, irritability, and neurodevelopmental problems dimensions. In the bass-ackwards approach, the broad externalizing factor reflects the shared variance of all CBCL items. These approaches provide different information and future work can expand on the present results by investigating the use of higher-order factor models.</p>

<span id="cb1-109"><a href="#cb1-109" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">  Recent years have seen a greater shift towards alternative nosological frameworks of psychopathology, which frequently include a dimension of externalizing psychopathology. The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) is one such framework. However, the HiTOP has been most often studied in adults and more research is needed in order to better understand the similarities and differences in the structure of externalizing psychopathology earlier in development. This preregistered study sought to examine the validity and utility of extending the HiTOP externalizing dimension and its subdimensions to youth using longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. There were two primary aims: Aim 1: Identify the hierarchical structure of externalizing psychopathology and examine evidence of discriminant validity of the identified dimensions; and Aim 2: Assess the longitudinal measurement invariance of a broad externalizing dimension in the ABCD study, as well as specific underlying symptom dimensions. Results for Aim 1 analyses identified a coherent factor structure comprising three dimensions (narrow externalizing, irritability, and neurodevelopmental problems), and these factors showed important similarities and differences in relation to external correlates. Aim 2 analyses showed that strong invariance was supported for the narrow externalizing and irritability dimensions, while partial strong invariance was supported for broad externalizing and neurodevelopmental problems. Quantification of measurement (non)invariance revealed small effect sizes. Collectively, these results highlight important directions for future research on the HiTOP model in the ABCD study and other youth samples.</span></span>

<span id="cb1-120"><a href="#cb1-120" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In recent years, researchers have increasingly pursued alternative nosological frameworks of psychopathology with the goal of enhancing etiological models and, ultimately, improving prevention and intervention efforts <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@eaton2023</span><span class="co">]</span>. One popular framework, the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">(</span><span class="co">]</span>HiTOP; @kotov2017], has generated significant research interest. The HiTOP aims to establish an empirically derived structure of psychopathology using techniques, such as factor analysis to identify transdiagnostic dimensions that explain covariation among observed symptoms. Importantly, the hierarchical organization of HiTOP incorporates general and specific symptoms of psychopathology, thereby avoiding the limitations of categorical approaches like that of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">DSM-5; @apa2013</span><span class="co">]</span>, including high rates of within-disorder heterogeneity and comorbidity <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@conway2022</span><span class="co">]</span>. Thus, the HiTOP aims to generate a nosological framework that is empirically valid and capable of benefiting both researchers and clinicians <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@kotov2021</span><span class="co">]</span>. Indeed, across a range of mental health problems, dimensional assessments produce greater validity and reliability compared to categorical assessments (e.g., Markon et al., 2011) and emerging evidence suggests that clinicians find more utility in transdiagnostic, dimensional approaches like HiTOP compared to traditional categorical approaches <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @balling2023</span><span class="co">]</span>. </span>

<span id="cb1-122"><a href="#cb1-122" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>However, the majority of research examining HiTOP has been conducted in adults, leaving notable gaps in our understanding of how it can be extended to youth during sensitive developmental windows. The present study examined whether components of the HiTOP model, specifically its externalizing dimensions, could be identified in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, a longitudinal, nationally representative study of youth in the United States. The longitudinal nature of the ABCD study allows for tests of whether externalizing dimensions are psychometrically invariant over time—an essential precursor to more advanced modeling techniques (e.g., latent growth models) that can be used to study trajectories of externalizing dimensions over development. Addressing these gaps has the potential to expand the relevance of HiTOP to earlier periods of development, a critical step to further advance HiTOP-focused research <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@tackett2022</span><span class="co">]</span>.   </span>

<span id="cb1-125"><a href="#cb1-125" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The HiTOP is organized along continuous dimensions, consistent with evidence showing that differences in psychopathology are a matter of degree as opposed to kind <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@haslam2012</span><span class="co">]</span>. The HiTOP is also hierarchical, reflecting decades of research establishing that symptoms can be organized into broader dimensions, which in turn can advance research on shared and distinct etiological mechanisms of psychopathology symptoms <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@lahey2017</span><span class="co">]</span>. At the finest level, the HiTOP provides descriptions of narrow behavioral (e.g., aggression, inattention) and interpersonal  (e.g., callousness) symptoms or traits. One can move up the hierarchy to broader dimensions that are called superspectra in the HiTOP (e.g., externalizing and internalizing psychopathology). This dimensional, hierarchical approach allows researchers to study features of psychopathology at varying levels of specificity.  </span>
<span id="cb1-126"><a href="#cb1-126" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-127"><a href="#cb1-127" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In adults, the externalizing superspectrum encompasses two lower order dimensions (termed spectra in the HiTOP): disinhibited externalizing and antagonistic externalizing <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@krueger2021</span><span class="co">]</span>. The disinhibited externalizing spectrum includes the tendency to act impulsively, with little regard for future consequences. The antagonistic externalizing spectrum reflects tendencies to navigate interpersonal situations with little concern for others, including a willingness to exploit and deceive others. The broader externalizing dimension has been linked to various maladaptive outcomes, including aggression, antisocial behavior, and problematic substance use <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @krueger2007</span><span class="co">]</span>, while the lower order spectra, including disinhibition and antagonism, offer greater specificity and show differential associations with external correlates <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@mullins-sweatt2022</span><span class="co">]</span>. For example, antagonism is more strongly related to various forms of aggression and antisocial behavior relative to disinhibitory symptoms <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@vize2018</span><span class="co">]</span>, while disinhibitory symptoms are more closely related to problematic substance use <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @venables2012</span><span class="co">]</span>. While there is substantial evidence supporting the presence of a broad externalizing dimension in youth <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @bongers2004</span><span class="co">]</span>, less work has examined whether the antagonistic and disinhibited HiTOP dimensions can be similarly captured in youth samples and if these spectra show unique associations with relevant clinical and psychosocial correlates.    </span>

<span id="cb1-129"><a href="#cb1-129" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">## Hierarchical Models of Externalizing Psychopathology in Youth</span></span>
<span id="cb1-130"><a href="#cb1-130" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>While the HiTOP has seen less direct application in youth samples, there is a rich history of dimensional and hierarchical models of psychopathology in youth. For example, models of externalizing psychopathology have been examined across a wide range of developmental periods, including preschool <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @hill2006</span><span class="co">]</span> and early adolescence <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @goulter2022</span><span class="co">]</span>. Across these studies, results have consistently shown that a broadband externalizing factor can be reliably assessed from more fine-grained indicators and the externalizing factor is reliably linked to specific problem behaviors (e.g., aggression and rule-breaking). Notably, this work used a wide variety of indicators to model higher-order externalizing dimensions, including DSM-based diagnostic symptoms <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @king2018</span><span class="co">]</span>, personality features <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @tackett2014</span><span class="co">]</span>, and biologically-based indicators like salivary cortisol levels <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @shirtcliff2005</span><span class="co">]</span>. Other relevant examples of externalizing-related research in youth involve research on hierarchical models of maladaptive personality that include antagonistic and disinhibitory personality features, which have also found strong support in youth samples <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @fruyt2014</span><span class="co">]</span>. Taken together, this work suggests that dimensional, hierarchical approaches like HiTOP can be successfully applied to youth populations—and, moreover, that HiTOP can serve as a unifying framework for many existing lines of developmental psychopathology research. </span>
<span id="cb1-131"><a href="#cb1-131" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-132"><a href="#cb1-132" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Along these lines, more recent work has sought to explicitly examine the HiTOP model in youth samples. For example, using data from the baseline assessment of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)TM study, @michelini2019 conducted a “bass-ackwards” factor analysis <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@goldberg2006</span><span class="co">]</span> using 102 items of the parent-report Child Behavior Checklist <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@achenbach1999</span><span class="co">]</span>. At the most specific level of the hierarchy, the authors identified five factors that they labeled externalizing, neurodevelopmental, internalizing, somatoform, and detachment. The authors noted that the factors mostly align with the structure of psychopathology as detailed in HiTOP, with the exception that the neurodevelopmental factor that emerged from the broader externalizing factor is not included in the HiTOP model. In a more recent effort, @forbes2023 pooled youth self-report data across various early- and mid-adolescent samples (age range=6-18 years old; N=18,290) to identify similarities and differences between the hierarchical structure of symptoms in youth and the HiTOP structure in adults. The broad factors identified were termed externalizing, eating pathology, uncontrollable worry/obsessions and compulsions, and internalizing. Additionally, more specific dimensions of externalizing were noted, including impulsive anger, antagonism, retaliatory anger, and positive psychosis.  While the antagonism dimension mirrored the antagonistic externalizing dimension in adults (i.e., consisting of items indexing aggression and cruelty towards others), no clear disinhibited externalizing factor emerged. Instead, items reflecting disinhibitory content (e.g., “Generally, I am an impulsive person”) showed primary loadings on the impulsive anger dimension. Thus, existing research has highlighted similarities and differences between the HiTOP model among adults and youth. Further research is needed to further clarify how the HiTOP could be extended to youth. </span>

<span id="cb1-135"><a href="#cb1-135" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In addition to characterizing the hierarchical structure of externalizing psychopathology in youth, it is important to determine whether this structure is consistent over time <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@vandenberg2000</span><span class="co">]</span>. Specifically, examining the longitudinal measurement invariance of externalizing psychopathology, or the degree to which the measurement of this latent construct is psychometrically equivalent over time, can help establish whether observed changes reflect true changes. Because the developmentally relevant behavioral and interpersonal manifestations of externalizing psychopathology are known to change across development <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@petersen2020</span><span class="co">]</span>, establishing longitudinal measurement invariance is necessary to ensure that observed changes are reflective of changes in externalizing rather than developmentally limited indicators. For example, decreases in temper tantrums are likely to reflect an independent developmental process separate from true decreases in a latent externalizing propensity. Longitudinal invariance is particularly important in the ABCD study, given its unique potential to serve as a scientific resource as a nationally representative, longitudinal study of youth and their families. The ABCD study is ideally situated to provide data that can better characterize risk and resilience factors for within-individual change in externalizing psychopathology. Thus, the transparent development of longitudinally invariant measurement models of externalizing dimensions is essential.  </span>

Specifically, we used the 45 CBCL items and item composites identified in factor analyses of the ABCD baseline data by @michelini2019 that had primary loadings on the externalizing factor and/or the neurodevelopmental factor. These two factors had a total of 45 items/item composites that showed either primary loadings on one of the factors or loaded on both factors without a clear primary loading (e.g., the item “impulsive or acts without thinking” had a loading of .49 on both the externalizing and neurodevelopmental factors).

Dimensional symptom counts for the following diagnostic constructs were used: conduct disorder (CD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder, suicidality/self-harm, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Each symptom was indicated as being present (1) or not present (0), and symptoms were summed such that higher scores indicate more symptoms endorsed for the diagnostic construct. Parents completed all KSADS-5 modules at the baseline assessment, while youth only completed mood disorder, social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, suicidality, and sleep modules at baseline.    </span>

The scale had 20 items assessing impulsivity (e.g., “I like to stop and think about things before I do them (reversed)”) and includes 5 subscales: negative urgency, positive urgency, lack of perseverance, lack of planning, and sensation seeking.

<span id="cb1-160"><a href="#cb1-160" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-161"><a href="#cb1-161" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Aim 1a Analyses**: We used parallel analysis and the minimum average partial correlation (MAP) to estimate the number of factors to extract from the 45 items/composites. Next, we used @forbes2023 recently developed extension to Goldberg’s “bass-ackwards” analysis [@goldberg2006] to identify the hierarchical structure of externalizing items/composites using the minimum residual factor extraction method and promax rotation. @forbes2023 extended bass-ackwards approach differs from the traditional approach in that it 1) identifies redundant components that perpetuate through multiple levels of the hierarchy; 2) aids in identification of artifactual components; and 3) plots the strongest factor correlations among the remaining factors to identify their hierarchical structure. Although past work has used similar factor analytic approaches on CBCL data in the ABCD sample [e.g., @michelini2019], by constraining our analyses to only focus on the 45 CBCL items/composites associated with broad externalizing, we expected more fine-grained differences to emerge in the hierarchical structure of the CBCL items/composites. **Aim 1b Analyses**: After identifying the hierarchical structure of externalizing dimensions, we assessed evidence discriminant validity by examining bivariate and semipartial correlations between the identified externalizing dimensions (assessed using factor scores) and external criterion measures (e.g., diagnostic symptom counts, prosocial behavior, impulsivity, fluid intelligence). Correlations for specific dimensions were also compared to one another using tests of dependent correlations to detect significant differences between correlations.  </span>
<span id="cb1-162"><a href="#cb1-162" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-163"><a href="#cb1-163" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Aim 2a Analyses**: Next, we examined the longitudinal measurement invariance of each externalizing dimension through a series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). Longitudinal measurement invariance was examined in typical fashion moving from configural to strong invariance. In some cases, we also examined strict invariance.  To test this, we created item parcels from the CBCL items based on a set of preregistered criteria. The item parcels served as the observed indicators of externalizing dimensions for all tests of longitudinal measurement invariance. **Aim 2b Analyses**: To quantify the degree of invariance, we computed Cohen’s d for mean and covariance structures <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">dMACS; @nye2011</span><span class="co">]</span>. These metrics index the collective impact of loading and intercept noninvariance in the metric of Cohen’s d, with higher values indicating a greater degree of indicator noninvariance.     </span>

<span id="cb1-166"><a href="#cb1-166" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>We had three primary hypotheses. Hypothesis 1a: We hypothesized that disinhibition and antagonism dimensions would be identified at more fine-grained levels of the hierarchy with the same items that have been shown to comprise a broad externalizing dimension. If parallel analysis and the minimum average partial correlation test (MAP) suggested a relatively large number of factors could be extracted from the CBCL items (e.g., 5 or more), we expected that the disinhibition and antagonism factors would emerge relatively early in the factor extraction process (e.g., at level 2 or level 3). Hypothesis 1b: We expected evidence of discriminant findings for the derived disinhibition and antagonism factor scores derived. Specifically, we hypothesized that the disinhibition factor would have larger (+) associations with ADHD, impulsivity, and fluid intelligence and the antagonism factor would have larger (-) associations with CD, ODD, and prosocial behavior. Furthermore, we expected these correlations to be significantly stronger than the correlations disinhibition and antagonism showed with internalizing outcomes. Hypothesis 2: We would be able to establish longitudinal strong measurement invariance for the measurement models of externalizing factors, facilitating future investigations of mean-level change over time in these externalizing factors in the ABCD study.</span>

<span id="cb1-171"><a href="#cb1-171" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Results of the parallel analysis based on polychoric correlations among the CBCL items suggested up to 14 factors could be extracted from the 45 CBCL items, while MAP suggested four factors for extraction. Consistent with our preregistered criteria for factor extraction, we interpreted the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-factor solutions.  However, the fourth factor of the solution was not substantively meaningful, and we thus focus on the 3-factor hierarchy.</span>

<span id="cb1-173"><a href="#cb1-173" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The first level of the bass-ackwards hierarchy was a broad externalizing factor with all 45 CBCL items showing moderately strong to strong standardized loadings on the factor (range=.47-.81). At the second level, a neurodevelopmental problems factor emerged, characterized by distractibility, poor motor coordination, and hyperactivity. The broad externalizing factor remained virtually unchanged and was strongly correlated with the broad externalizing factor from level 1 of the hierarchy (r=.96). At level 3, the neurodevelopmental problems factor remained unchanged (r=1.00 with the level 2 factor). However, the broad externalizing factor split into a narrower externalizing and an irritability factor, both of which were strongly related to the broad externalizing factor (rs=.91). The narrow externalizing factor was characterized by aggression (e.g., threatening others, fighting), meanness to others (e.g., cruelty, bullying, lack of guilt), and rule-breaking behaviors (e.g., stealing, destroys composite), and the irritability factor was indexed by items related to affective reactivity and lability, hostility, and distrust of others. These three levels of the hierarchy are displayed in Figure 1. The extracted factor scores from level 3 were strongly related to the broad externalizing factor score (r range=.80-.87) from level 1 and positively related to one another (r range =.52-.62). </span>

At the bivariate level, all factors were positively associated with symptom counts across all disorders and informants, and associations were stronger for parent-reported symptoms (r range=.07-.66) compared to youth-reported symptoms (r range=.04-.16). Furthermore, these factors tended to be more strongly related to symptoms of CD, ODD, and ADHD (r range=.31-.60) compared to symptoms of depression and anxiety (r range=.04-.32). </span>

The neurodevelopmental problems factor was unrelated to CD (sr=-.02) and ODD (sr=-.04) symptoms, and strongly associated with ADHD symptoms (sr=.50). Associations with depression and anxiety symptoms were notably smaller, and after accounting for overlap, the narrow externalizing factor demonstrated a negative association with generalized (sr=-.12) and social (sr=-.05) anxiety disorder symptoms. The irritability factor showed the strongest association with depression (sr=.20) and generalized anxiety symptoms (sr=.21) and the neurodevelopmental problems factor with social anxiety disorder (sr=.13). Notably, there was little difference across the three factors in the strength of associations with suicidality/self-harm (sr range=.08-.11).</span>

At the bivariate level, all factors were negatively associated with prosocial behavior, and these associations were stronger for parent-report (r range=-.22 to -.35) compared to youth-report (r range=-.06 to -.09).

All factors showed similarly sized positive associations to all indices of impulsivity, though these were notably small in magnitude (r=.04-.16). The narrow externalizing and irritability factors showed the strongest associations with negative urgency (.16 and .15, respectively), and the neurodevelopmental problems factor was most strongly associated with lack of perseverance (r=.18). Semipartial correlations were smaller in magnitude, but similar to one another. The exception was the relation between neurodevelopmental problems and lack of perseverance (sr=.18), compared to the relation to the other factors (sr range=-.02-.03).     </span>

All factors were negatively associated with fluid intelligence, though these associations were small in magnitude. The neurodevelopmental problems factor demonstrated the strongest negative association (r=-.17), followed by the narrow externalizing factor (r=-.14), and the irritability factor (r=-.08).

<span id="cb1-189"><a href="#cb1-189" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>All items were randomly assigned to parcels, and the parcels were used as indicators of a given latent factor at baseline, one-year follow-up, two-year follow-up, and three-year follow-up assessments. **Supplementary Table S1** provides details on the number of items assigned to each parcel and item content for each parcel. **Supplementary Tables S2-S5** provide descriptive statistics for the parcel indicators for each factor. **Table 2** provides results for all tests of longitudinal measurement invariance. All models of the broad externalizing factor and the three narrower factors showed excellent absolute fit across all invariance tests, and strong standardized factor loadings for the parcels (λs=.58-.89) in the configural models, as well as strong stability over time (rs=.68-.81).

<span id="cb1-191"><a href="#cb1-191" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>*Broad Externalizing Factor*. Relative to the configural model, restricting factor loadings to be equal (i.e., test of weak invariance) did not decrement model fit (ΔCFI=.001; ΔNCI=.005). However, constraining the parcel indicator intercepts to be equal across time (i.e., the test of strong invariance) did result in a significant decrement in model fit (ΔCFI=.004; ΔNCI=.026). In an attempt to establish partial strong invariance, we freed the intercept constraints on parcels 4 and 5 based on modification indices.  This model demonstrated excellent overall fit (χ^2=947.21; df=152; RMSEA=.021; CFI=.994; TLI=.992) and showed no decrement in model fit compared to the weak invariance model of broad externalizing (ΔCFI=.000; ΔNCI=.001), indicating that partial strong longitudinal measurement invariance was supported. Given that full strong invariance was not supported, we did not test for strict measurement invariance. </span>

<span id="cb1-193"><a href="#cb1-193" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>*Narrow Externalizing Factor*.

<span id="cb1-195"><a href="#cb1-195" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>*Irritability*. Model fit was not significantly impacted by adding constraints for weak or strong measurement invariance.

<span id="cb1-197"><a href="#cb1-197" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>*Neurodevelopmental Problems*. Relative to the configural model, model fit was not significantly impacted after constraining factor loadings to be equal (ΔCFI=.002; ΔNCI=.005), indicating weak measurement invariance. However, after imposing constraints on the intercepts of the parcel indicators (strong invariance), model fit was significantly negatively impacted (ΔCFI=.006; ΔNCI=.018). Based on modification indices, the intercepts of parcels 3 and 4 were freed at baseline and three-year follow-up. The resulting partial strong measurement invariance model showed excellent overall fit (χ^2=524.25; df=88; RMSEA=.020; CFI=.993; TLI=.991) and no decrement in model fit compared to the weak invariance model (ΔCFI=.002; ΔNCI=.005), indicating that partial strong longitudinal measurement invariance was supported.</span>

<span id="cb1-200"><a href="#cb1-200" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Table 3** provides results for dMACS and additional effect sizes (i.e., proportion of mean change in the latent factor attributable to noninvariance) for the broad externalizing factor and neurodevelopmental problems factor (i.e., the two factors for which noninvariance was detected).  Results showed that the effect sizes of indicator noninvariance were small, with dMACS ranging from .00-.18. While dMACS summarized the magnitude of noninvariance at the indicator level, there was a more noticeable impact of noninvariance at the latent level of the broad externalizing dimension, with noninvariance accounting for between 25-30% of observed mean change in the dimension across the pairwise comparisons.             </span>

<span id="cb1-203"><a href="#cb1-203" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>We conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of our results relative to other analytic choices. This included 1) examining alternative factoring and rotation methods for our bass-ackwards analysis, 2) exploring the impact of variability in item-parcel allocation on measurement model parameters (i.e., loadings) and model fit statistics, and 3) examining the impact of cluster effects of family and study site in the ABCD study. Overall, sensitivity analyses showed that all results were robust to these factors. An overview of these analyses and results are provided in Supplementary Materials (see **Section II** and **Table S6**).</span>

<span id="cb1-206"><a href="#cb1-206" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    The present study sought to delineate the hierarchical structure of externalizing symptoms in the ABCD study, and evaluate the longitudinal measurement invariance of the identified dimensions. Overall, there was mixed support for our preregistered hypotheses. Specifically, in our bass-ackwards analysis, we did not find evidence for easily interpretable disinhibition or antagonism dimensions (*Hypothesis 1a*) and instead identified three factors: narrow externalizing, irritability, and neurodevelopmental problems. There was support for the discriminant validity of the specific externalizing dimensions (*Hypothesis 1b*) and, consistent with our hypothesis (*Hypothesis 2*), strong measurement invariance was established for two of these factors (narrow externalizing and irritability). While strong invariance could not be established for the broad externalizing and neurodevelopmental problems factors, a less restrictive model (partial strong invariance) was supported. Importantly, effect size metrics for longitudinal invariance highlighted the necessity of examining the impact of noninvariance at the level of indicators and latent dimensions, as noninvariance showed the greatest impact on the latent level here. Together, results have implications for extending the HiTOP model to youth and for future research on the development of externalizing problems in the ABCD study as well as other prospective, longitudinal studies.        </span>

<span id="cb1-208"><a href="#cb1-208" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Hierarchical Structure of Externalizing Psychopathology: Links to the HiTOP Model** </span>
<span id="cb1-209"><a href="#cb1-209" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>While the current study identified a broad externalizing dimension that strongly aligns with the externalizing superspectrum of HiTOP <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@krueger2021</span><span class="co">]</span>, the specific externalizing dimensions showed greater divergence from what has been found in adults. Contrary to hypotheses, clear disinhibition or antagonism dimensions were not identified. Instead, three dimensions with notable links to prior work and some similarities to the HiTOP model emerged. The first was a narrow externalizing dimension, consisting of aggression, meanness to others, and rule breaking behaviors. This factor mirrored antagonism dimensions identified in similar HiTOP-focused analyses in youth samples, which included items associated with aggressive behavior and meanness toward others <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@forbes2023</span><span class="co">]</span>. In our sample, this dimension also contained content aligned with rule-breaking behavior (e.g., stealing, vandalism), which stands somewhat in contrast to past research highlighting the importance of distinguishing rule-breaking behaviors from more overtly antagonistic behaviors like aggression <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@burt2012</span><span class="co">]</span>. Interestingly, even at subsequent levels of the bass-ackwards hierarchy, this narrow externalizing factor did not split into more more specific antagonistic (e.g., aggression, callousness) or rule-breaking factors, suggesting that these features could not be empirically separated. While this may be related to developmental timing and/or the nature of this community sample, it will be important to continue examining the hierarchical structure of externalizing pathology across development, and empirically determine if and when these dimensions differentiate in the ABCD Study.</span>
<span id="cb1-210"><a href="#cb1-210" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-211"><a href="#cb1-211" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Results also identified an irritability dimension, characterized by affective reactivity and lability, hostility, and distrust of others. While not predicted, this dimension echoes prior work documenting the central role of irritability in early manifestations of externalizing behavior in youth <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@leibenluft2013</span><span class="co">]</span>. Notably, characteristics of the irritability dimension found here – hostility and distrust of others – are similar to features of the antagonistic externalizing dimension that has been identified in adult samples <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@mullins-sweatt2022</span><span class="co">]</span>. However, this dimension was also characterized by a general moodiness that is not explicitly interpersonal in nature, and may point to affective lability as a developmental precursor to interpersonal hostility. In addition, extant research shows that irritability is an important subdimension of externalizing behaviors in youth that predicts subsequent internalizing psychopathology <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @burke2012</span><span class="co">]</span>. Moreover, irritability is a transdiagnostic factor observed in an array of psychiatric disorders, and can help to explain the co-occurrence of externalizing and internalizing problems <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@finlay-jones2023</span><span class="co">]</span>. Thus, irritability represents an important dimension within developmental models of externalizing behavior and extensions of the HiTOP to youth. </span>
<span id="cb1-212"><a href="#cb1-212" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-213"><a href="#cb1-213" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>A neurodevelopmental problems dimension defined by inattention and hyperactivity emerged and remained intact across all levels of our bass-ackwards hierarchy. Notably, much of the factor content aligns with ADHD symptoms, and past structural work in the ABCD study has labeled related factors “inattention” or “ADHD” factors <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @clark2023</span><span class="co">]</span>. Nonetheless, the presence of such a factor echoes prior work on the structure of psychopathology in youth <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@michelini2019; @holmes2021</span><span class="co">]</span> and underscores the importance of this dimension in developmental models of externalizing behavior. Moreover, the emergence of this dimension dovetails with other research emphasizing the importance of understanding neurodevelopmental problems as a transdiagnostic dimension in youth psychopathology <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@astle2022</span><span class="co">]</span>. Past research has also emphasized the importance of neurodevelopmental problems in the onset and persistence of antisocial behavior <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@goozen2022</span><span class="co">]</span>, which further contextualizes the presence of neurodevelopmental problems within the domain of youth externalizing problems. </span>

<span id="cb1-215"><a href="#cb1-215" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Evidence of Discriminant Validity for Externalizing Dimensions**</span>
<span id="cb1-216"><a href="#cb1-216" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The three identified externalizing dimensions demonstrated evidence of discriminant validity based on their bivariate correlations. This was most notable for parent-reported diagnostic symptom counts and prosocial behavior, which may be unsurprising given shared method variance. The largest differences between dimensions were observed for disorders that are typically conceptualized as externalizing, with the narrow externalizing factor demonstrating the strongest association with CD symptoms, the irritability factor with ODD symptoms, and the neurodevelopmental problems factor with ADHD symptoms. </span>
<span id="cb1-217"><a href="#cb1-217" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-218"><a href="#cb1-218" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Controlling for overlap among the dimensions generally enhanced this pattern of discriminant validity, but several results are noteworthy. First, the unique variance in the narrow externalizing dimension showed the smallest relations to internalizing symptoms and was negatively related to anxiety disorder symptoms, while maintaining similar relations with conduct disorder symptoms and prosocial behavior. Thus, the unique aspects of this dimension appear to be aligned with callous-unemotional features—past research has demonstrated how these features are weakly related to broad internalizing problems <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@cardinale2020</span><span class="co">]</span> and demonstrate negative relations with with anxiety specifically <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @frick1999</span><span class="co">]</span>. Second, the irritability dimension maintained the strongest associations with mood and anxiety symptoms even after accounting for overlap between factors, echoing research pointing to irritability as a transdiagnostic indicator of psychopathology <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@finlay-jones2023</span><span class="co">]</span>. Finally, the unique variance in neurodevelopmental problems was unrelated to CD, and ODD symptoms as well as prosociality. This finding has implications for research on “cool” (abstract-cognitive) and “hot” (reward-related) executive functioning systems, and suggests that the unique variance in the neurodevelopmental problems dimension appears to largely reflect the “cold” end of the hot-cold continuum in executive function <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@zelazo2020</span><span class="co">]</span>.  </span>

<span id="cb1-220"><a href="#cb1-220" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Longitudinal Measurement Invariance for Externalizing Dimensions** </span>
<span id="cb1-221"><a href="#cb1-221" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Tests of longitudinal measurement invariance showed that strict invariance held for the narrow externalizing dimension  and strong invariance held for the irritability dimension. Statistically, strong invariance indicates that all longitudinal changes in the means and covariances of the indicators can be attributed to changes in their respective latent dimensions across time <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@grimm2017</span><span class="co">]</span>. Substantively, strong invariance indicates that researchers can conduct comparisons across time for these externalizing dimensions and investigate their associations with other variables without worrying that the indicators have been systematically influenced by unmeasured factors <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@sidaman2010</span><span class="co">]</span>. Notably, partial strong invariance was met for the broad externalizing and neurodevelopmental problems factors, indicating that longitudinal changes in observed indicator means and covariances are attributable to changes in the latent means, *but only for the longitudinally invariant indicators*. Given that the neurodevelopmental problems factor, in particular, focuses on developmentally specific content that likely manifests differently as youth mature, some degree of noninvariance is unsurprising <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@petersen2020</span><span class="co">]</span>. Though strong invariance is the typical benchmark that must be met before making mean comparisons across time, researchers commonly use partial strong invariance models of externalizing <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @king2018</span><span class="co">]</span> and simulation-based investigations have found that using partially invariant models for subsequent analyses does not result in biased parameters in common applied settings <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@shi2019</span><span class="co">]</span>. Taken together, findings provide empirical support for the examination of between- and within-person change in these latent externalizing dimensions over time. </span>
<span id="cb1-222"><a href="#cb1-222" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-223"><a href="#cb1-223" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Additionally, our investigation of invariance effect sizes, while not commonly assessed or reported, points to important additional areas of consideration.  First, all *dMACS*  for the broad externalizing and neurodevelopmental problem models (i.e., the two models where noninvariant indicators were detected) fell below our preregistered threshold for inferring meaningful impact of measurement invariance (*dMACS* &lt; .20). This suggests that even though our previous tests indicated that constraining intercepts significantly worsened model fit, the difference in indicator intercepts across time was very small — providing further support for the notion that our findings of only partial strong invariance for certain factors do not preclude their use in subsequent analyses. Second, despite the consistently small *dMACS* effect sizes, there was a noteworthy impact of noninvariance but only at the latent level of broad externalizing. Specifically, between 25-30% of observed mean differences were due to measurement invariance. Substantively, this suggests that comparisons between the broad externalizing dimension at baseline and later time points will overestimate mean differences if this bias is not taken into account. These results highlight a well-known, but infrequently examined, implication of measurement noninvariance [@vandenberg2000]—that the cumulative effects of noninvariant indicators can lead to larger biasing effects at the latent level (observed for broad externalizing), or in other cases, indicators can cancel out, leading to almost no bias at the latent level (observed for neurodevelopmental problems). Results underscore the importance of examining the effect of longitudinal noninvariance at the latent *and* indicator level <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@clark2021</span><span class="co">]</span>. Future work examining the latent broad externalizing factor over time would need to consider the biasing impact of noninvariance. For other externalizing dimensions, the impact of noninvariance was trivial (neurodevelopmental problems) or there was evidence in support of strong measurement invariance (narrow externalizing, irritability), suggesting the examination of their trajectories will reflect true changes and not measurement artifacts.    </span>

<span id="cb1-225"><a href="#cb1-225" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Limitations**</span>
<span id="cb1-226"><a href="#cb1-226" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>While the current study addresses notable gaps in the literature, results should be considered in light of several noteworthy limitations. First, as is the case with any factor analytic technique, the solution is dependent on the input <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@fabrigar1999</span><span class="co">]</span>. That is, our results assume that the CBCL items provide sufficient coverage of the externalizing dimension. While the CBCL is well-validated and extensively used in developmental samples, insufficient coverage of any specific content (e.g., lying) and/or low base rates of less developmentally salient behaviors (e.g., substance use) limit our ability to identify such dimensions. This point is important to keep in mind when drawing comparisons with other studies that have utilized different measures of externalizing behaviors <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @forbes2023</span><span class="co">]</span> as they may differ in content coverage that generate divergent factor solutions, particularly at more fine-grained levels. </span>
<span id="cb1-227"><a href="#cb1-227" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-228"><a href="#cb1-228" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Second, externalizing dimensions were assessed using a single informant (i.e., parent-report) and it is perhaps unsurprising that associations with external clinical correlates were strongest for parent-reported indices. Given that cross-informant reliability for externalizing psychopathology in youth is consistently low <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@reyes2004</span><span class="co">]</span>, it will be particularly important to examine the structure of externalizing dimensions in the ABCD study using alternative informants (e.g., youth, teacher). Additionally, expanding beyond monomethod assessments and incorporating multiple levels of analysis to more precisely conceptualize psychopathology constructs dimensions will be important <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @joyner2023</span><span class="co">]</span>. </span>
<span id="cb1-229"><a href="#cb1-229" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-230"><a href="#cb1-230" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Finally, while the present study made use of recommended best-practices when using parcels <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">see @sterba2023</span><span class="co">]</span>, including a transparent preregistration, empirically identified unidimensional factors, and inclusion of sensitivity analyses examining the impact of item-parcel allocation variability, the use of parcels has well-documented limitations. For example, their use necessarily overlooks fine-grained psychometric information about specific items. Though our focus was on latent externalizing dimensions and not item psychometrics per se, item-level characteristics are valuable to understand and future work could aim to better assess this and further refine the assessment of externalizing dimensions. </span>
<span id="cb1-231"><a href="#cb1-231" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-232"><a href="#cb1-232" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Future Directions**</span>
<span id="cb1-233"><a href="#cb1-233" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>An important goal is to further expand investigations into the HiTOP in youth to better understand the lower-order structure of psychopathology symptoms. Our findings are in line with emerging evidence suggesting that the broad externalizing dimension of HiTOP is compatible across adults and youth <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @michelini2019; @forbes2023</span><span class="co">]</span>; however, organization of finer-grained dimensions is less consistent. A valuable question for further research would be to examine the replicability of the finer-grained dimensions of externalizing symptoms identified here, using alternative assessments, informants, and developmental timepoints. </span>
<span id="cb1-234"><a href="#cb1-234" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Future research can also examine other factors relevant to measurement invariance (e.g., sex, ethnicity) using the measurement models developed in the present study. However, subgroup analyses using the parcel developed in the present study would necessitate further sensitivity analyses, as within-sample item-parcel allocation variability is proportional to sampling error <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@sterba2010</span><span class="co">]</span>, meaning that our use of the total sample in the ABCD study helped minimize item-parcel allocation variability. </span>
<span id="cb1-235"><a href="#cb1-235" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-236"><a href="#cb1-236" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Last, future work can also examine alternative hierarchical modeling frameworks. Our bass-ackwards approach can be contrasted with higher-order factor models estimated from ABCD study data <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @clark2023</span><span class="co">]</span> in terms of how variance is partitioned—in higher-order factor models, each level of the hierarchy is based on different variances. For example, the broad externalizing dimension in a higher-order model would represent the shared variance among narrow externalizing, irritability, and neurodevelopmental problems dimensions. In the bass-ackwards approach, the broad externalizing factor reflects the shared variance of all CBCL items. These approaches provide different information and future work can expand on the present results by investigating the use of higher-order factor models.</span>
